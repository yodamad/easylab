description: HTML template conventions for EasyLab — HTMX patterns, template structure, and frontend guidelines.
globs: **/*.html
---
- Use semantic HTML5 elements with HTMX attributes (hx-get, hx-post, hx-target, hx-swap)
- Follow the base template pattern: extend web/base.html, define {{block "title"}}, {{block "content"}}, {{block "scripts"}}
- Prefer HTMX interactions over custom JavaScript — JS is only for logic HTMX can't handle
- Use hx-trigger="load, every 10s" for polling job status updates
- Keep page-specific JS in web/static/{page-name}.js
- Style with the existing web/static/style.css — use existing CSS classes (btn, error-message, success-message, etc.)
- Escape dynamic content with template.HTMLEscapeString to prevent XSS
- Do NOT modify existing templates unless explicitly asked by the user
