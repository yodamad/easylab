# Coverage Exclusion Configuration
# This file documents what code is excluded from coverage reports
# to focus on critical business logic rather than entry points and test infrastructure.

## Excluded Packages/Files

### Main Entry Points
# These are thin wrappers that orchestrate the application but don't contain
# critical business logic. Excluding them provides a clearer picture of actual
# code coverage for the core functionality.
- main.go                          # Root Pulumi application entry point
- cmd/server/main.go                # Web server entry point
- cmd/server/main_test.go           # Server entry point tests

## Included Packages

### Critical Business Logic (Included in Coverage)
# These packages contain the core business logic and should be fully covered:
- ./internal/...                    # Core server logic (handlers, auth, jobs, pulumi)
- ./utils/...                       # Utility functions (config, git, logging)
- ./coder/...                       # Coder integration logic
- ./ovh/...                         # OVH cloud provider integration
- ./k8s/...                         # Kubernetes integration

## Notes

- Test files (*_test.go) are automatically excluded by Go's coverage tool
- This configuration is used by Makefile targets and coverage-report.sh script
- Frontend coverage exclusions are configured in tests/coverage-helper.ts
